# Password-manager
Simple portfolio project for generating and managing passwords.

Idea behind this project is to create simple GUI for password managment and generating random passwords.
You can toggle some specific character types you want to include in your password.
You can save your generated password with your username and with your web-page.
Also you are able to see list of all your passwords.

Ttkbootstrap library was used for GUI.
